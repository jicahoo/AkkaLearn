1. Not closing over sender:

Page 157:
When we were looking at Actors before, we saw that closing over the
sender is not something we want to do, simply because it’s a method that
returns the current value. If we close over it, then the value returned when
the closure executes will probably not be what it was when we made the
closure. Just to be clear, that’s not what’s happening when we schedule the
Drink response. The second parameter of scheduleOnce() takes a proper
ActorRef, not a by-name parameter, so the sender is frozen at the point of
scheduling.
